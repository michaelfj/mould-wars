							<h3>Toxic mould</h3>
							<p>Toxic mould is dangerous and we think you should learn about how to control it. This site can help you get started.

							<br><br>Medical doctors generally only worry about mould in immune suppressed patients in hospital settings. This situation exists partly because mould infections are difficult to diagnose using routine pathology in the local clinic setting. In GP offices doctors mostly diagnose infections on the basis of anti-body responses detected in blood tests. However when toxic mould enters the body it discards its outer protein coat and displays an inner polysaccharide coat that does not contain proteins to which the immune system can attach antibodies.

							<br><br>Mould can infect your body in many places - the skin, nose, mouth, sinus, bowels, brain and internal organs. Fungi can colonise the membrane surfaces and fluids in body cavities and can spread into the vascular system when the blood is rich in sugar (as in diabetes) and the immune system is compromised.

							<h2>How can mould survive inside your body?</h2>
							<p>Fungi can live inside your body by producing mycotoxins and VOCs (volatile organic compounds) that either directly block or corrupt your immune system. While mould can surround itself with toxic chemicals to keep the local immune cells at arms length, it much prefers to have the immune system protect it.</p>

							<h2>How can mould get the immune system to protect it?</h2> 

							<p>The author, using <a href="bioresonance.html">bioresonance technology</a>, is confronted on a daily basis however with clear signs of immune system corruption by toxic mould in many clients. Toxic mould can use chemical toxins to induce the regulatory cells of the immune system near its colonies to release suppressive cytokine proteins like TGFbeta, VEGF and Interleukin-10. These cytokines quieten down the germ-killing WBCs in the area which then leave the mould colonies alone.  

							<br><br>The level of these proteins can be measured in your blood stream and you could ask your doctor to order tests for TGFbeta, VEGF and IL-10 although the cost of testing can be quite high. If one of these results is high the test could be repeated in a few weeks to see if the level remains high. If the result is again high it is possible that you have a toxic mould problem.</p> 

							<h2>CIRS</h2>

							<p>Dr. Richie Schumacher from the USA has written much about mould disease - what he has called CIRS, the Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome. He discusses TGFbeta and VEGF in his book "Surviving Mold"(ADD REF). Dr.Schumacher documented elevated levels of these cytokines in patients affected by living in water-damaged buildings teeming with airborne toxic mould spores. These spores are tiny and can penetrate deep into the lungs. Our lungs have immune resources in place to deal mould spores in small numbers but not in the sort of quantity that would enter the lungs from the air of a water-damaged building.   

							<br><br>Dr.Schumacher has done much great pioneering work in this area but, without bioreosonance technology, he not seen the exact mechanism behind the inflammatory state.</p> 

							<h2>Corrupted regulatory WBCs</h2>

							<p>The writer has found that toxic mould uses one of its mycotoxins and/or VOCs to induce one of the regulatory white blood cells - either <a href="Treg.html">Treg</a>, <a href="Bcells.html">Breg</a>, <a href="M2monocyte.html">M2 Monocyte</a> or Mast cells - to constantly release immune suppressive cytokines mainly TGFbeta-2 and VEGF. 

							<br><br>The mould appears to surround itself with these corrupted regulatory cells by releasing a homologue of the WBC attractant protein CXCL1. Mould seems to release CXCL1 under the influence of mercury. This would be curtains for the mould if the immune cells were not corrupted, as it would surround itself with cells that would eventually destroy it.  

							<br><br>Once the mould as hit upon a toxin formula that corrupts one of the regulatory WBCs, it begins to expand its colonies and spread into the body accompanied by the corrupted regulatory cells. The spread is largely into the vascular system and involves the major arteries. First is often the gastric or pancreatico-duodenal arteries. The aorta, common iliac, femoral, pulmonary, vertebral and carotid arteries are favoured as is the Circle of Willis in the brain. Large veins are also colonised - the vena cavae, hepatic, splenic, pulmonary, jugular and subclavian veins are popular colony sites.

							<br><br>As mould colonies start to proliferate in the vascular system, the amount of suppressive cytokines released by the corrupted WBCs increases. The whole immune system becomes skewed and
							the behaviour of the white blood cells as a whole changes. Mostly this change is to a TH2 dominance but it can go the other way to TH1 dominance if the cytokine Gamma Interferon is involved.

							<br><br>In the TH2 skewing pattern the monocytes, bone marrow-derived white cell that migrate into the tissues to become macrophages, are induced to become the M2 variety. <a href="M2monocyte.html">M2 monocytes</a>, under the influence of TGFbeta, can mimic the behaviour of the corrupted Treg and/or Breg cells and also release TGFbeta and other immune suppressive cytokines like IL-4, IL-13, and IL-35.    

							<br><br>In the TH1 pattern monocytes develop into the <a href="M1monocyte.html">M1</a> variety under the influence of Gamma Interferon. This can produce a state of inflammation in the body especially in the skin as the tissues are stacked with ever more M1 monocytes. The main issue for the mould is that it gets to survive and it works to induce the uncontrolled release of Gamma Interferon.

							<br><br><span>Aspergillus</span> and <span>Fusarium</span> species can each produce more than 30 mycotoxins, some of which are potent immune suppressants(<a class="ref" name="intro2" href="images/Boletim46_Mycotoxin_List.pdf">2</a><a class="ref" name="intro2" href="ref.html#intro2">r</a>). These toxins enable mould to survive inside our bodies especially if there are faults with our immune systems. 

							<br><br>The commonest fault is a takeover of the spleen engineered by one or both of these fungi often with the help of <span>Candida albicans</span>. Up to 15 different mycotoxins and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) may have to be simultaneously released in order to overwhelm the spleen immune cells but these moulds can combine their resources to do this. Once the spleen has gone down the numbers of mature T cells and Natural Killer (NK) cells steadily drops and the moulds can spread deep into the body.

							<br><br>Other toxic moulds include <a href="#.html#eurot"><span>Eurotium</span></a>, <a href="#.html#chaet"><span>Chaetomium</span></a> and <a href="#.html#stachy"><span>Stachybotris</span></a>. However they lack the survival ability of the top three and will not be much discussed. 

							<br><br>This website will explore:<br>- the ways fungi can get into our bodies<br>- how we can best prevent exposure, and<br>- how we can rid our body of mould.

							<br><br>The material presented here is written by <a name="biores" href="bioresonance.html">bioreosonance</a> practitioner with decades of experience in the  treatment of fungal and parasitic diseases.
