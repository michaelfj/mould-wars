							<h3>Bioresonance Devices</h3>
							<p>Biological resonance ("bioresonance" in short) is a phenomenon that has been extensively investigated in countries like Germany and Russia over many decades. Many devices based on bioresonance are made in these countries and there are thousands of doctors and other health practitioners using them. Some devices are marketted around the world to complementary health practitioners. They are generally frowned upon by mainstream medical authorities with the excuse that they do not have sufficient "high level" scientific evidence. A very active internet sceptics community makes every effort to publish information critical of these devices at every available opportunity.</p>

							<h2>So what is bioresonance?</h2>
							<p>Biological resonance is an electro-magnetic phenomenon. The atoms that make up our bodies are composed of particles that are vibrating, zooming about and spinning in characteristic ways. It is not possible to record the activiy of a single particle with a portable device, however many devices have been invented in the past 50 years that can recognise the vibrational energy pattern of a significant collecion of like atoms. This might be for example the presence of a large number of toxic atoms in a body organ. It is thus possible using bioresonance to detect the presence of a build up of mercury atoms in the liver. German doctors and dentists were doing this 50 years ago in their attempts to understand the negative health effects of mercury amalgam fillings(<a class="ref" name="bio1" href="ref.html#bio1">1</a>).

							<br><br>Aside: many older people are suffering the toxic effects of this dental material. In my childhood it was common practice for dentists to drill out and fill healthy molars with mercury amalgam as a preventive strategy. Many dentists still hold the opinion that they are doing nothing wrong putting one of the most toxic metals known in your mouth.</p>

							<p>The resonance energy patterns of mercury atoms and of liver tissue are just two signals in what have become massive digital databases in these devices. With considerable effort on the part of the inventors, over 100,000 different chemicals, germs, tissues, cell components, proteins, hormones, minerals, vitamins have been converted into digital signals to make up these databases. An experienced bioresonance practitioner will be able to quickly determine if you have too much mercury (or other common toxin) in your body. The practitioner should also be able to determine the condition of your various organs using these devices, and help remove the toxins discovered.</p>
							<h2>What is the evidence for bioresonance?</h2>
							<p>The fairly simplistic model of "Drug vs Placebo" testing that so dominates medical scientific research nowadays does not work well for bioresonance devices. In the history of bioresonance in Germany since the 1950s there have been very few studies published that would be considered now as high-level evidence (HLE). This lack of HLE continues to be used even now in Germany as justification to block bioresonance consultations from being eligible for rebates from health insurers.<br><br>German doctors wrote books on the technical details of their devices, using a methodology that relied heavily on Homeopathy(REF), and published small scale studies of the results of their work with the devices. In the 1990s there were over 2,000 doctors in Germany practising with the old style of EDS (Electro-Dermal Screening) device like the VEGA and MORA(<a class="ref" name="bio2" href="ref.html#bio2">2</a>), while nowadays there are over 20,000 doctors and health practitioners using newer devices. The company that makes one of the most popular, the VegaTest Expert, claims over 12,000 of this device are in use in Germany. There is no intensive research program such as that being run by wealthy pharmaceutical companies, just a body of practitioners making a living offering a treatment method that often helps where mainstream medical practice struggles to find a solution.</p>

							<h2>What can be achieved with bioresonance?</h2>
							<p>The skill and experience of the practitioner is the key to success in bioresonance. The more training they have had in mainstream and complementary medical disciplines the better. The more time the practitioner has had practising their craft the better. If you choose to go to a bioresonance practitioner then choose one with a waiting list even though you may have pressing health concerns. There may be little value in choosing a practitioner who can see you tomorrow. However if you book an appointment with a busy practitioner and their reception rings you next week with a cancellation then take it - it is a gift to you from the universe. If you do not believe in such gifts then just call it good luck.</p><br>
